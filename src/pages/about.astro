            Nicholas C. Steiner is a Research Assistant Professor in the
            <Link href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/eas">Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at The City College of New York</Link>.
            His work advances microwave remote sensing of wetlands, terrestrial hydrology, and the carbon cycle with an emphasis on translating satellite observations into decision-ready environmental intelligence.

          <p class="text-justify">
            Nick leads and contributes to <Link href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/earth-science/">NASA Earth Science</Link> projects that harness missions such as
            NISAR, SMAP, ECOSTRESS, CYGNSS, and GEDI. His team develops multi-sensor approaches that combine radar, radiometry, lidar, and thermal data to monitor inundation dynamics, quantify vegetation water stress, and track cryosphere change from the Arctic to the Amazon.

          <p class="text-justify">
            He collaborates closely with partners at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Advanced Science Research Center at CUNY, and municipal stakeholders in New York City.
            Field campaigns like SMAPVEX19-22 and the NISAR Tropical Wetlands Validation Experiment inform the lab’s modeling frameworks and open datasets.
            Nick mentors graduate and undergraduate researchers through project-based learning, including the SUS7502C capstone and quantitative methods courses focused on geospatial data.
